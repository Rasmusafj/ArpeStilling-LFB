# 02806 Social Data Analysis - Final Project

Link to the live website: https://klstilling.github.io/ArpeStilling-LFB

The JavaScript scripts using D3 for visualizing crime data are found in the `js/` directory.

The IPython notebook for the initial data analysis and dataset preparation
and preprocessing is found in the `explainer_notebook/` directory.
We have chosen not to include the raw datasets in this repository since they
are contained in large files. Links to the datasets can be found in the
explainer notebook.

The `data/` directory contains the extracted datasets used for the D3 visualizations.

`css/`, `d3/` and `vendor/` contains various files used for styling etc. of the
website.
